<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Dear Future Self</strong><br> When you'll find these files, forgotten in your github account...read below</p>
I built this site as a fun exercise with a serious goal: not to forget all the reasons and circumnstances why I picked up a certain book at a certain time and started reading it.
<br>And the thoughts that came with that reading, and what time of my life that was etc...

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>One of life's regrets</strong><br>All the Maths missed at school (or the Maths they don't teach you?). <br>Never again.</p>
