Interesting read.

Main points I appreciated and found best explained:

- Inflation
- Fine tuning
- Multiverse as one of the three possible explaination for the fine tuning of the Universe.
- CMB

Plus:
- A Good overview of the Standard Model, with nice explainatory pictures.

Minus:
- pumped up and auto-referential at times.
