## When I read it
June 2021. Part and first of the biographies I intended to read. Is this really a biography?

## Why I picked it up and thoughts
I thought it was the right book to introduce myself to the genius of Richard Feynman.
It was one the most quoted and reference author in the books I was reading.

It turned out it was indeed a good introduction, but mostly to the men not to the physics of the man.



## Interesting bits

### Curiosity
The main point in the book that resonated: how the different stories in the chapters show that curiosity is the driver, whatever the topic/situation is.
Look inquisitively at everything that happens.

### Speech at Brasil university
On the status of teaching in the world and how the approach actually kills all curiosity and desire to tinker or find out more

## Quotes

## Inspiration & Next

I bought QED to get more into the physics part. Very "curious" about Feynman's diagrams.
