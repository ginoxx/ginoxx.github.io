## Inspiration & Next

Dawkins's "The Blind Watchmaker" is a natural follow up (maybe should have read before this - anyway, bumped up in TBR list). Dennet seems to pontificate and higly admire Dawkins.

Other titles referenced in the book and TBR'ed:

Prisoner's Dilemma: John Von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb - William Poundstone

The Recursive Universe: Cosmic Complexity and the Limits of Scientific Knowledge - William Poundstone

Dennett's book on consciousness (Consciousness Explained).

Dennett is one of my new heroes.
