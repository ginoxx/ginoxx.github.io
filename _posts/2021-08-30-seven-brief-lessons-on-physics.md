Nice little book for a quiet evening

## When I read it
Received it as a present for my 46th birthday and started reading it on a Bank holiday monday, all in one go.

## Why I picked it up
I am interested in Rovelli's work, maybe more curious than interested and I was keen to see how he would expose certain topics.




## Interesting bits

### In general
I like the approach.
Good way to try and explaing certain things to dumb audience like myself.
It mostly served as a review and check point for me on  the topics (particles, quanta etc..) he briefly exposes, now that I am trying to make sense of 20th century physics in general.


## Quotes

## Inspiration & Next

I already had Rovelli's book on time and to him I have chosen him for the task to explain it to me.
