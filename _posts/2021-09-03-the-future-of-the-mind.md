Remarkable yes, great not sure. Let us say interesting...

## When I read it
Summer 2021 just before going back to work

## Why I picked it up
I was flabbergasted by Kaku's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/physics-of-the-impossible/">Physics of the Impossible</a>  and I was curious about his take on the mind from a physics perspective, since I was reading other books on the subject.
