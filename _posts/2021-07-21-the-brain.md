>Whe think color as a fundamental quality of the world around us. But in the outside world, color does not actually exists.


## When I read it
Bought in a rush of curiosity while visiting Notting Hill's "small" Waterstones branch

## Why I picked it up
Reading a lot of physics lately and wondering how physics applies to the brain. What is it made of? How communication, memories work? Certainly not expecting to find all the answer here, but I was looking for a place to start.

## Interesting bits

### Vision and coordination of the senses
### Reality as projection of the mind cross checked by difference with senses (internal model)
### Internal model: low-resolution but upgradable
### Brain is like a city
### Consciousness vs auto-pilot of uncosciousness

## Quotes

## Inspiration & Next

Next steps: Read Kaku's "The future of the Mind"
Objective: be able to understand (eventually) Roger Penrose's "The emperor's mind" (given as a present for Christmas 2020).
