Tiny fun book to read while waiting for lunch to be ready, in one go.

## When I read it
One Sunday summer of 2021, while waiting for lunch to be ready.

## Why I picked it up
It was a present and I was curious to see how much Du Sautoy had been able to pack in this tiny book (50 pages)




## Interesting bits

### PI headaches
And irrational numbers, like the square root of 2

### Infinity Hotel
This was the best part for me. Are there different types of infinity? Does it help us counting?
