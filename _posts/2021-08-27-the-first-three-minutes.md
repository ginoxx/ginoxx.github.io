Seminal book.
Seemingly comfortable book to read, it was instead very challenging and to the limit of my understanding given the implied maths knowledge


## When I read it
Just after Prof. Weinberg sadly <a href="/people/steven-weinberg/">passed away</a>.
It was already in my shelf, and I could not postpone it anymore.

## Why I picked it up
Simply because it is Weinberg and you can't miss on his (although quite dated now) account of the origin of the Universe, if you are into that.





## Interesting bits

### Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
Great account of that. Read like a novel.

#### Overview on the initial conditions of the Universe
#### Recipe for the Universe to be what it is





## Quotes

## Inspiration & Next

Keep studying Gino, this only the tip of the iceberg. We need 10000 of Weinbergs.
