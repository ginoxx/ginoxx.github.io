I wonder why I am knowing about this stuff only now!

What a book and what a journey!


I loved:

- Infinity principle as base for calculus to work
- Curves, Motion, Change
- Multiverse as one of the three possible explaination for the fine tuning of the Universe.
- Background radiation

>Why is the universe comprehensible, and why is calculus in sync with it?
