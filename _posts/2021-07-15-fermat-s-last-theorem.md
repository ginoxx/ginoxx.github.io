>Cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadratoquadratos, et generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos ejusdem nominis fas est dividere: cujus rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.


There are no positive integers such that **x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> = z<sup>n</sup>** for n>2. I've found a remarkable proof of this fact, but there is not 
enough space in the margin [of the book] to write it.

Did Pythagoras coin the term *philosopher* and therefore *philosophy*?


>Pythagoras replied "I am a philosopher" but Leon has not heard the work before and asked him to explain

Page 10

>“Life, Prince Leon, may well be compared with these public Games for in the vast crowd assembled here some are attracted by the acquisition of gain, others are led on by the hopes and ambitions of fame and glory. But among them there are a few who have come to observe and to understand all that passes here. It is the same with life. Some are influenced by the love of wealth while others are blindly led on by the mad fever for power and domination, but *the finest type of man gives himself up to discovering the meaning and purpose of life itself. He seeks to uncover the secrets of nature. This is the man I call a philosopher for although no man is completely wise in all respects, he can love wisdom as the key to nature’s secrets*.”
