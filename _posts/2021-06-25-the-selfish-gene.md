## When I read it
I chose not to read this book all at once, but instead looking at specific things at specific times. It was between 2019-21.

## Why I picked it up
Well, this is certainly a book you want to have read at some point of your life.
I had read The God Delusion (LINK) earlier, and I really wanted to get more into the evolution side of things.


## Interesting bits

### Concept of selfish
### Monogamy and Evolution


## Quotes

## Inspiration & Next

I want to re-read it or part of it. First I want to read The Blind Watchmaker though.
Looking for biological arguments about the "fine tuning" and around.
