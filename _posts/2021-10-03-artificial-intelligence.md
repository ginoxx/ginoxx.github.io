Just right


## When I read it
September 2021

## Why I picked it up
Looking for something to bridge the gap between reading of Dennet, Penrose, Kurzweill etc and tinkering with ML models and python for my AI learning.


## Summary
It bridged the gap..
Provides the basic tech/theory to understand what it is roughly going on while recognising or classifying images, translating etc. what algorithms are at play and what they are doing.
Nice historical summary as well (the usual turing, kasparov, DeepBlue, Watson & Jeopardy! etc).. fun to read.



## Interesting bits

### Symbolic & subsymbolic
#### Rules vs patterns
#### Weighting & Back propagation
#### Techniques of self-learning
#### Perceptron 
#### Deep learning and hidden layers

#### Insights on thw HOW
Image recognition, image classification, words understanding, NLP, translation etc

### Account of Kurzweil and the singularity



## Quotes

She quotes an exchange from Star Trek TNG..thumb up!

## Inspiration & Next

Hofstaeder is on target now (I will read his latest "I am a strange loop" rather than GEB - I don't want to read that book!)
Kurzweil out of curiosity maybe
